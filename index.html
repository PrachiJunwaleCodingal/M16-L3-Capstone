    Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is a
    22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails (small sticks) balanced on three
    stumps. Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats,
    while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the opposite end of
    the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with
    the batting team scoring one run for each of these exchanges.
